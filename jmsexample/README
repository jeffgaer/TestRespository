This example builds three executable  in the director target/appassembler/bin
jmsServer, a simple jmsServer
publisher a utility to publish a test message
subscriber a utility that subscribes to a topic and prints out a text message when ever one is received

jmsServer takes no arguments its configuration comes from configuration xml files under config.
It is configured with one topic TopicOne and listens on port 4350

to execute the example open three windows and cd to target/appassembler/bin

in window one execute jmsServer

in window two start the subscriber with the correct parameters ( note must  use host name or ip localhost does not work
./subscriber <hostname> 4350 TopicOne

in window three publish some messages 

./publisher <hostname> 4350 TopicOne <msgText>

You should see the messages printed out in the subscriber window. 

You should be able to directly use the subscriber as is with just implementing what you want done with the message text. To modify
there is an inner class in subscriber DoSomeWork. Its onMessage method is called whenever a message is published to the Topic it is subscribed to.
